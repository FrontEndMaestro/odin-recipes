    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck.
        It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.
        </br>
        Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his
        college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted
        here will easily serve eight people.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Bell peppers</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce & crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Ricotta</li>
        <li>Mozarella(shredded)</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste,
            and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded
            mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
        </li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a
            layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
